# Introduction

Recall that machine learning models can only consume numeric data, and that numeric data should be "1"s or "0"s. Data is said to be "messy" or "untidy" if it is missing attribute values, contains noise or outliers, has duplicates, wrong data, upper/lower case column names, and is essentially not ready for ingestion by a machine learning algorithm.

This notebook presents and solves some of the most common issues of "untidy" data. Note that different problems will require different methods, and they are beyond the scope of this notebook.

Each learning objective will correspond to a #TODO in this student lab notebook -- try to complete this notebook first and then review the solution notebook.
